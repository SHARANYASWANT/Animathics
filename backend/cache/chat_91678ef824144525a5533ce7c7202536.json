Let's break it down.\n\n### What is the Pythagorean Theorem?\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem describes a special relationship between the sides of a **right-angled triangle**.\n\n**Key things to know before we start:**\n\n1.  **Right-Angled Triangle:** This theorem *only* works for triangles that have one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees (a \"right angle\"). You can usually spot this angle because it's marked with a small square symbol.\n\n    "

    "content": "Okay, let's switch gears and talk about the **area of a square**! This is a very common and foundational concept in geometry.\n\n### What is \"Area\"?\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"area\" means.\n\nImagine you have a flat surface, like a piece of paper, a table, or a floor. The **area** is the amount of **two-dimensional space** that surface covers.\n\nThink of it like this: If you wanted to tile a floor, the area would tell you how many tiles you need to cover the entire floor without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n### What is a Square?\n\nBefore we find its area, let's quickly review what a square is:\n\n*   It's a **four-sided shape** (a quadrilateral).\n*   **All four sides are equal in length.** This is super important for finding its area!\n*   **All four angles are right angles** (90 degrees).\n\nHere's a quick drawing:\n\n```\n  Side (s)\nA ----------- B\n|             |\n|             | Side (s)\n|             |\nD ----------- C\n  Side (s)\n```\n\n### How to Calculate the Area of a Square\n\nBecause all sides of a square are equal, calculating its area is quite straightforward.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself.\n\nIf we let 's' represent the length of one side of the square:\n\n**Area (A) = side \u00d7 side**\n\nOr, using mathematical notation:\n\n**A = s \u00d7 s**\n\nWhich is often written as:\n\n**A = s\u00b2** (read as \"s squared\")\n\n### Why does this formula work? (The Intuition)\n\nLet's say you have a square with sides that are 3 units long (it could be 3 inches, 3 cm, 3 meters, etc.).\n\nImagine dividing this square into smaller squares, each 1 unit by 1 unit.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n| 1 | 2 | 3 |  <-- 3 units across (side)\n+---+---+---+\n| 4 | 5 | 6 |\n+---+---+---+\n| 7 | 8 | 9 |\n+---+---+---+\n^\n|\n3 units down (side)\n```\n\nIf you count the small 1x1 squares, you'll find there are 9 of them.\nUsing our formula:\nArea = side \u00d7 side = 3 units \u00d7 3 units = 9 **square units**.\n\nThis shows you that multiplying the side by itself literally tells you how many unit squares fit inside the larger square!\n\n### Units of Area\n\nThis is crucial! When you calculate area, your units are always \"squared.\"\n\n*   If the side is in **centimeters (cm)**, the area is in **square centimeters (cm\u00b2)**.\n*   If the side is in **meters (m)**, the area is in **square meters (m\u00b2)**.\n*   If the side is in **inches (in)**, the area is in **square inches (in\u00b2)**.\n\n### Let's do an example!\n\n**Question:** A square garden has a side length of 5 meters. What is the area of the garden?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Identify the shape:** It's a square.\n2.  **Identify the given information:** Side length (s) = 5 meters.\n3.  **Recall the formula:** Area (A) = s\u00b2\n4.  **Substitute the value:** A = 5 meters \u00d7 5 meters\n5.  **Calculate:** A = 25\n6.  **Add the correct units:** A = 25 square meters (m\u00b2)\n\nSo, the area of the garden is 25 square meters. This means you could fit 25 individual 1-meter by 1-meter squares inside the garden.\n\nDoes that explanation make sense? Would you like to try an example yourself?"
